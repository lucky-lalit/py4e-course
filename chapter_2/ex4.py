# Exercise 4: 
# Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type 
# (of the value of the expression).

#     width//2

#     width/2.0

#     height/3

#     1 + 2 * 5

# Use the Python interpreter to check your answers.

width = 17
height = 12.0

value = width//2 
value1 = width/2.0
value2 = height/3
value3 = 1 + 2*5  
print(value)
print(value1)
print(value2)
print(value3)
